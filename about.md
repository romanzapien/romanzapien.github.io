<p>Hi there! My name is Román Zapién-Campos. I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions & UKRI Postdoctoral Fellow at University College London. I am interested in the ecology and evolution of microbial communities. My work has primarily relied on mathematical modelling of dynamical systems (especially stochastic modelling). However, I increasingly try to combine these models with laboratory experiments and analysis of published data.</p> 

<p>I work with Wenying Shou to develop methods enabling parameter inference from time series data. In particular, I investigate cases where incomplete data, e.g. where cells are measured but chemicals are not, prevents inferring all or some parameters. As it turns out, the "missing" variables are a headache in microbiology, but also across the biological sciences and beyond. Our theoretical works show that tracking statistical information beyond averages (e.g. variances, covariances, etc) in a set of replicates can enable the inference of parameters (this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_identifiability">structural identifiability</a>). This combination of theory and experiments have sparked my interest in experimental design and automated model discovery towards quantitative microbiology.</p>

<p>Before joining UCL, I was a PostDoc at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology (Plön, Germany), where I also completed my PhD and learned all I know about stochastic modelling. I worked with Arne Traulsen in the Theoretical Biology department, closely collaborating with the CRC1182: Origin and Function of Metaorganisms, where we developed theoretical models of microbiome ecology across the tree of life.</p> 

<p>Earlier in my career, I also investigated the persistence of microbial diversity in highly antagonistic communities using cellular automata (BSc thesis with Gabriela Olmedo-Álvarez and Moisés Santillán - IPN, Mexico) and the requirements to sustain microbial mutualistic interactions over long timescales in a spatial model (MRes thesis with David Murrell - UCL).</p> 

<p>A complete list of my publications can be found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TyfoFisAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>.</p> 

<p>Do not hesitate to get in touch. Have a great day! :)</p>
