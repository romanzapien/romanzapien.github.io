<p>Hi there! My name is Román Zapién-Campos. I am a researcher interested in microbial biology — more concretely on their ecology and evolution. Although I have mostly relied on theoretical approaches, I am interested in combining these with experimental methods, aiming for dialogue between theory and experiments.</p> 

<p>Currently, I am a PostDoc at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology (Plön, Germany), where I also completed my PhD (December 2021). I work with Arne Traulsen in the Evolutionary Theory department, studying the ecology and evolution of microbes associated with hosts.</p> 

<p>Before coming to Plön, I was involved in other research projects. For my BSc thesis in IPN (Mexico), I worked on a cellular automaton to investigate the preservation of microbial diversity in highly antagonistic communities. After this, during my MRes thesis in UCL (UK), I investigated how to engineer microbial interactions leading to a stable mutualism.</p> 

<p>A list of my publications can be found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TyfoFisAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>.</p> 

<p>I am always up to chat about science. Please feel free to reach me out on my email or Twitter. Have a nice day! :)</p>
